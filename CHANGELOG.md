### Changed

  release binaries


## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- Show coinbase distribution in grafana dashboard
- Upgrade to p2poolv2 hydrapool.v0.4.0

### Changed

- BREAKING: Use bitcoin compatible serialisation of shares in
  database. This requires that you nuke your existing store.db
  directory and start the server from no data. We want to make this
  change early before any servers are using Hydrapool at scale. We are
  not shipping a script to migrate existing data - if you really need
  it, please reach out to us and we'll try to make it work for
  you. Ideally, a PR will be welcome too with a script to migrate the
  rocksdb data.
